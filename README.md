# SteamAccountManager
Some really good type of people need a lot of accounts for steam, and I am one of them, this thing allows you to switch between accounts by clicking 2 buttons

# HOW TO USE ? 
1) Add your account in name(basically give your account a name)/username/pass textboxes (data saves on your PC and it's not sending this to anyone). It will save data in C:/someData.txt folder. (changes are permanent unless u change something in this file)
